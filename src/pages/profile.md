[Richard Schirripa](https://www.cake.me/richard-schirripa.amp) has an extensive lifetime pharmaceutical leadership background. He was the Owner of Drug Rich Pharmacy , Madison Avenue Pharmacy and Carnegie Hill Health and Beauty Aids, all located in the upper east side of Manhattan.

Along this career journey, Mr. Schirripa earned an undergraduate degree at the State University of New York at Farmingdale and the State University of New York at Stony Brook, and a BS in Pharmacy at the Brooklyn College of Pharmacy (now Arnold and Marie Schwartz College of Pharmacy), a graduate school of Long Island University.

Mr. Schirripa first started working in a pharmacy in 1968 at the age of 14, and fulfilled basic functions of stocking inventory, sweeping floors, and making deliveries. Also responsible for handling the cash register, he took on progressively greater responsibilities, ultimately overseeing a trio of Kings Pharmacy locations as general manager. In 1982, after approximately 14 years at Kings Pharmacy in Brooklyn, serving in virtually every capacity available, Mr. Schirripa set out to start his own business. He opened Drug Rich Pharmacy, a neighborhood pharmacy serving the East Harlem/Upper East Side community in Manhattan. For nearly 25 years he owned and operated the pharmacy. Starting as a 700 square foot store with 1 employee, he built Drug Rich Pharmacy into a 2100 square foot full service pharmacy with approximately 20 employees. He continue to operate the store until 2006 when it closed.

In 1989, several years after opening Drug Rich Pharmacy, Mr. Schirripa opened his second pharmacy, Madison Avenue Pharmacy, which was also located in the East Harlem/Upper East Side community, near Mt. Sinai Hospital. Madison Avenue Pharmacy was one of the original pharmacies which serviced the Health For Heroes Program through Mount Sinai Hospital. This program provided vital medications to the First Responders of 911 and all others affected by the tragedy. Madison Avenue Pharmacy was the primary independent pharmacy which provided pharmaceutical services for the World Trade Center program. Madison Avenue Pharmacy was sold to Walgreen Pharmacy in September of 2019 just before Covid.

Mr. Schirripa's interests include Paleontology and Archeology as well as golfing, fly fishing and gardening.

Community focused, Richard Schirripa presently volunteers with the ELC Food Pantry of Northport/East Northport, NY.
